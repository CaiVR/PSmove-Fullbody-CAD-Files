# PSmove-Fullbody-CAD-Files
Hip Controller &amp; PSeye Camera mount CAD files
This is a quick repository made for the 3D models and CAD I created for use with the PSmove service for full body tracking in VR, currently containing wall mounts for PSeye cameras, and a custom casing for a Hip controller.

Designed for use with the screws holding the regular PSmove controller together. May need to use 2mm tall washers to hold PCB in with them. 

NOTE - There are actually a few different variations of PCB shape for the PS3/4 move controllers, so the STL files I have designed and used myself may not fit the PCB of your controller. In light of this I have provided the actual .f3d file containing the design for the hip controller, for anyone to modify to their content. If anyone would be willing, I would also like to add other designs to this repository to have an option for everyone. Thanks.
